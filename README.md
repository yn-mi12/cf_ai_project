# 📷 Photography Chat Agent

An applicaton that fetches and displays images from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com) using an AI chat agent built with Cloudflare Agents. It uses the [Cloudflare agents-starter](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents-starter) template as a starting point and builds on it by introducing a custom MCP server to connect to the Unsplash API.

## ✨ Features

- Interactive chat interface with AI
- Dark/Light theme support
- Tool integration for image searching and display in chat
- Real-time streaming responses
- State management and chat history
- Modern, responsive UI

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Cloudflare account
- Unsplash client ID

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yn-mi12/cf_ai_project.git
cd cf_ai_project
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up your environment:

Create a `.dev.vars` file and add your Unsplash client access key:

```env
UNSPLASH_CLIENT_ACCESS=your_unsplash_client_access_key
```

The client access key can easily be obtained by creating an app in your [`Unsplash developer account`](https://unsplash.com/developers). You also obtain a secret key (`UNSPLASH_CLIENT_SECRET`) that may be necessary when developing more advanced tools.

4. Run locally:

```bash
npm start
```

5. Deploy:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

## 💬 How to use

1. Open the application in your browser.
2. Type a message in the chat input box describing the type of images you want to see and the number of images. For example: "Show me 3 images of mountains at sunrise.", "give me 5 pictures of cute puppies".
3. The AI agent will show the prompt and fetch the images
4. Alternatively, you can just ask general questions or have a conversation with the AI agent.

## Customization Guide

### 🔄 Changing MCP Resource

You can modify the MCP server in `tools.ts` to connect to different APIs or services.To do this, update the `initializeUnsplashMcp` function to interact with your desired API:

```typescript
export function initializeYourMcp(env?: { YOUR_API_KEY?: string }) {
  const mcp = new McpServer({
    name: "your-mcp",
    version: "1.0.0",
    description: "MCP server for your API"
  });

  mcp.registerResource(
    "your-resource",
    "Uri of your resource",
    {},
    async (_uri, extra) => {
      console.log("HEADERS", extra.requestInfo?.headers);
      return {
        contents: [
          {
            uri: "https://your-api-endpoint.com",
            mimeType: "text/html",
            text: "Your API Resource"
          }
        ]
      };
    }
  );
}
```

You will also need to add any necessary authentication headers to the requests and any secret keys to your environment variables in .dev.vars:

```
YOUR_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

and env.d.ts:

```typescript
interface Env {
  YOUR_API_KEY?: string;
}
```

### 🔧 Adding New Tools

Add new tools in `tools.ts` using the tool builder - You can create tools that either require confirmation before execution or auto-execute upon invocation. You can also choose to register a tool for the mcp server:

```ts
// For example, a tool that requires confirmation before execution to see a particular user's collections in Unsplash
const seeCollections = tool({
  description: "See specific user's collections",
  inputSchema: z.object({
    query: z.string().describe("Search query")
  })
  // No execute function - requires confirmation
});

// Register the tool with MCP server
mcp.registerTool({
  name: "seeCollections",
  description: "See specific user's collections",
  inputSchema: {
    type: "object",
    properties: {
      query: { type: "string", description: "Search query" }
    },
    required: ["query"]
  }
});
```

To handle tool confirmations, add execution functions to the `executions` object:

```typescript
export const executions = {
  seeCollections: async ({
    query,
    userId
  }: {
    query: string;
    userId: string;
  }) => {
    const results = await fetch(`your-api-endpoint.com?userId=${encodeURIComponent(
      userId
    )}`
    ...
    //apply the actual logic you want here
    );

    return results;
  }
  // Add more execution handlers for other tools that require confirmation
};
```

Tools can be configured in two ways:

1. With an `execute` function for automatic execution
2. Without an `execute` function, requiring confirmation and using the `executions` object to handle the confirmed action. NOTE: The keys in `executions` should match `toolsRequiringConfirmation` in `app.tsx`.

### 🤖 Use a different AI model provider

The starting `server.ts` implementation uses the [`workers-ai-provider`](https://sdk.vercel.ai/providers/community-providers/cloudflare-workers-ai) with `llama-3.1-8b-instruct-fp8`, but you can use any AI model provider by:

1. Installing an alternative AI provider, such as the [`OpenAI`](https://ai-sdk.dev/providers/ai-sdk-providers/openai) or [`anthropic`](https://sdk.vercel.ai/providers/ai-sdk-providers/anthropic) provider:
2. Replacing the AI SDK with the [OpenAI SDK](https://github.com/openai/openai-node)
3. Using the Cloudflare [Workers AI + AI Gateway](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/providers/workersai/#workers-binding) binding API directly

For example, to use the [`OpenAI provider`](https://ai-sdk.dev/providers/ai-sdk-providers/openai), install the package:

```sh
npm install @ai-sdk/openai
```

Replace the `workers-ai-provider` import and usage with the `@ai-sdk/openai`:

```diff
// server.ts
// Change the imports
- import { createWorkersAI } from "workers-ai-provider";
+ import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";

// Create an openai model instance
- const workersai = createWorkersAI({ binding: env.AI });
- const model = workersai("@cf/meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct-fp8");
+ const model = openai("gpt-4o-2024-11-20");
```

### 🎨 Modifying the UI

The chat interface is built with React and can be customized in `app.tsx` and the component files. You can:

- Modify the theme colors in `styles.css`
- Add new UI components in the chat container
- Customize message rendering and tool confirmation dialogs
- Add new controls to the header

## 🔮 Future Improvements

There is room for many improvements. Here are some potential enhancements and features that could be added to improve the Photography Chat Agent:

### 🤖 AI and Machine Learning Features

- **Better Prompt Engineering**: Learn to switch better from conversation mode to tool usage. Read user intent more accurately - e.g., when they want images vs. when they want text answers, learning from context. Recognize when to ask clarifying questions and when the query is implied (e.g "a picture" = 1 picture).

### 🎨 User Experience Improvements

- **Advanced Search Filters**: Add filters for image orientation, color, size, and licensing types
- **Search History**: Add search history and favorites functionality
- **Bulk Operations**: Enable bulk download and batch processing of images

### 🔌 Integration and API Enhancements

- **Multi-Platform Support**: Integrate additional image providers (Pexels, Shutterstock, Getty Images)
- **Social Media Integration**: Add tools for direct sharing to social media platforms
